**Context**
To explore, treat and visualize the dataset, build a linear regression model to predict the prices of used cars, and generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the business.
**Objective**
To preprocess the raw data, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data pre-processing and build a linear regression model and evaluate to predict the prices of used cars.
**Key Question**
What are the key factors influencing the price of an used car?
Is there a good predictive model for the prices of an used cars?
What does the performance assessment look like for such a model?
**Data Information**
Each record in the database provides a description of an UsedCars. A detailed data dictionary can be found below.
